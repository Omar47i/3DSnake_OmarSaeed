# 3DSnake_OmarSaeed
A simple 3D snake project using Unity 3D

External help:
The game has been made from scratch, though the following tools has been used:
- iTween plugin - Downloaded from unity asset store. (Read the External Code section in Technical Design Document for more information).
- 3D models:  Used 3D assets from my previous projects and other online resources only as a proof of concept. So please donâ€™t reuse in any form (free or commercial).
